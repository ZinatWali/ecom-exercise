# Customer order app using React

This project is provisioned and hosted using AWS Amplify. It has a React front end that communicates with Python Lambda functions in the back end via API gateway. The front end application uses Cognito user pool for managing user authentication. Dynamo DB tables have been used for storing order and inventory details. 

This was a quick demo code produced within a limited amount of time. The back end data models are not comprehensive and Amplify was used to expedite infrastructure provisioning. Amplify uses CloudFormation under the hood and the CloudFormation scripts are available in the repo. A working demo is available on request.

While Amplify was used for the backend infrastructure, the React front end and Lambda codes are entirely bespoke.
